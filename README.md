## Q&A and Discussions

We will be using Blackboard for email, questions, and class discussions. Rather than emailing questions, I highly encourage you to post your questions on Blackboard.

## Course Description

The goal of this class is to give students an introduction to and hands on experience with all phases of the data science process using real data and modern tools. Topics that will be covered include data formats, loading, cleaning, data storage in relational & non-relational stores and data visualization.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion, students will be able to:

*	Understand conceptually the basics of machine learning like hypothesis space, probability, classifier, dimensionality reduction, cross validation etc.
*	Be introduced to basic unsupervised learning methods, such as clustering
* Learn a few key supervised learning techniques. Examples include decision trees, linear and logistic regression, Bayesian classifiers, Support Vector Machines
* Apply the learned techniques to some analytics problem through a project.

## Course Format and Assignments

Students will complete assigned homework assignments, readings, projects. This course incorporates a variety of hands-on labs and practical exercises to engage students and prepare them for challenges they may encounter in a workplace.

The final project will provide students opportunity to showcase what they have learned in a format similar to what they will encounter in a professional work setting.

## Grading Criteria

Students are expected to participate in class discussions. Student participation is encouraged & expected; watching recorded lectures outside of class does not count towards attendance!

Homework assignment will be mostly due Sunday. For homework due dates please check the - Weekly schedule below.

### Academic Integrity

Use of any artificial technical assistance (i.e., ChatGPT or other generative technologies) outside of onboard spellcheck and tools like Google Scholar, academic library databases, or reference managers—and solutions/projects found on the internet—are considered **academic misconduct** and strictly forbidden.  

If your solutions or reports are determined to be in this category, you will receive **0 (zero)** for that assignment.  

- The faculty member will notify the student in writing within five calendar days, if feasible, of the initial determination and provide a copy of this document to the student.  
- The student shall have an opportunity within five calendar days of notification to respond and give an explanation to the faculty member.  
- The faculty member will then make a decision as to whether an infraction has occurred.  
- If it has, the faculty member will determine whether the infraction is less serious or more serious and follow the procedures outlined in: [UMBC Graduate School Policy and Procedures for Student Academic Misconduct](#)
