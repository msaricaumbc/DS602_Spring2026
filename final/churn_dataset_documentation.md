# Streaming Service Customer Churn Prediction

## Business Context

**StreamFlix** is a popular streaming service that wants to identify customers who are likely to cancel their subscription within the next 30 days. Early identification allows the company to implement targeted retention strategies, such as personalized content recommendations, promotional offers, or customer support outreach, to reduce churn and maintain revenue.

This dataset does NOT include the target variable. The data scientist must analyze the data and ask the subject matter expert if a customer will churn for a limited number of times.

## Using the Subject Matter Expert (SME)

The SME class allows you to query churn for specific customer profiles.

### Example Usage:

```python
from streamflix_sme import SME

# Initialize SME
sme = SME()

# Query churn
# Pass index 
churn = sme.ask(12)

print(f"Churn: {churn}")
```

### Important Notes:
- You can ask up to 500 times (sme has other tasks.)
- If no matching records found, SME will raise an exception
